# pinn-benchmark-ai-assistants

Benchmark study comparing AI coding assistants on the task of generating
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) pipelines for the 1D Burgers' equation.

Final class project for **IA382A — Seminars in Computer Engineering (1S2026)**,
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC), UNICAMP.

## Project Overview

This repository documents an evaluation of AI-generated PINN pipelines from a
**data engineering perspective**, across three layers:

| Layer | What is evaluated |
|---|---|
| **Physics Correctness** | PDE residual formulation; convergence vs. analytical baseline |
| **Pipeline Engineering Quality** | Modularity, reproducibility, training loop design |
| **Prompt Efficiency** | Iterations required to reach a functional implementation |

The benchmark task is solving the **1D viscous Burgers' equation**:

```
u_t + u·u_x = ν·u_xx
ν = 0.01/π,  x ∈ [-1, 1],  t ∈ [0, 1]
IC: u(x, 0) = -sin(πx)
BC: u(-1, t) = u(1, t) = 0
```

Inspired by the seminar *"Scientific Machine Learning and Quantum Utility:
A Near Future Perspective"* (FEEC Seminar Series, 2024).
